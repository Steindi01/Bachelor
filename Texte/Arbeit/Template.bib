 abstract = {Measurement is the basis of the scientific method. If we can measure two things, we can compare them. Until we can do this with computer networks, we will not have a field of network science. Being able to compare two traces from computer networks in a quantifiable, holistic, and meaningful way provides us better insight into the network, and enables a range of applications for forensics, administration, application and protocol development, traffic generation, and general network intelligence. In this work we propose a methodology for such a quantifiable comparison of two network traces, be they from different networks, or the same network at different times. This methodology is intended to be the primary contribution in this work to advance the state of the art. The basic approach of the methodology is to define all the possible relevant metrics available in a trace, extract those metrics from both traces, find the similarity for each individual metric between the two traces, and combine the similarities into an overall similarity metric by summing together their weighted values. The proper way to determine these weights was inconclusive. The bulk of this work -- volume wise -- is dedicated to the construction and application of a specific instantiation of this methodology on IPv4 traffic. We begin by testing against artificial traffic, then show its applicability using a large number of publicly available network traces. The key contributions of this work are a set of characteristics for comparing IPv4 traffic, and methods for modeling and comparing network characteristics.},
